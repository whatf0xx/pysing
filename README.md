# pysing

*A pure Python generator for Ising model microstates.*

## About

Are you studying a course in statistical mechanics and are sick of being told that the individual microstates don't matter,
that the bulk behaviour can be found analytically? Just want to look at some sweet scale-free patterns that you can tell yourself
have physical significance without melting your brain with a fractal dive? Teaching a course in statistical mechanics and in need
of some cute visualisations of the magic going on behind the master equation?

Then look no further, this is the repository for you!

### How it works

See my blog entry: TBC

## Example

## How to

Clone the repository into a new folder. Add matplotlib and numpy to a virtual environment.

`python -m run`
